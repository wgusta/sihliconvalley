# INPUT
- Company name + role
- Hiring manager name (from LinkedIn job posting or company site)
- User's LinkedIn connections list

# STEPS
1. Map: User's 1st/2nd/3rd degree connections at target company
2. Assess: Path quality (strong/moderate/weak ties)
3. Prioritize: Strong ties > weak, mutual connections, alumni, board members
4. Draft: Outreach messages for each path (personalized, not template)

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Markdown:
- Hiring Manager Identified (name, role, LinkedIn)

## PATH QUALITY SCORING

- Former colleague now at target company
- Close friend knows hiring manager personally
- Alumni from same program (active in network)
- Professional collaboration (co-authored, co-presented)
- Board member or advisor

**MODERATE PATH (use with caution):**
- Acquaintance at company (met once at event)
- 2nd degree via moderately close 1st degree
- Shared LinkedIn group with interaction history

**WEAK PATH (don't use):**
- Never actually met
- 3rd degree connection
- No shared context beyond LinkedIn

## OUTREACH FORMULA

**Path 1 (Strong):**
```
Subject: Kurze Frage zu [Company] [Role]

Hi [Name],

Hoffe es geht dir gut! Ich habe gesehen, dass du [connection to company].

Ich bin auf deren [role] Ausschreibung gestossen—passt perfekt zu meiner aktuellen Arbeit mit [relevant project].

## REFERRAL IMPACT

**Data:**
- Referred candidates: **10× more likely** to get interview
- Board member referral: Even higher weight
- Referral from hiring manager's direct report: Strong signal

**Why bold positioning helps referrals:**
"[Applicant]'s a versatile PM" → Hiring manager thinks: "So are 100 others"
"[Applicant]'s THE cultural transformation specialist—85% adoption" → "I need to meet this person"

## COLD APPLICATION STRATEGY (if no warm path)

1. **Deep research:** Find company's recent initiative (exhibition, project)
2. **Reference specific:** "Impressed by your [X project]..." in cover letter
3. **Portfolio link:** bioco.ch, badenLEG with case study
4. **LinkedIn follow-up:** After 1 week, message hiring manager:
   ```
